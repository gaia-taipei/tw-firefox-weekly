## 2015 Q4 Goals
1. Support TV 2.5 feature - Provide an ability to preview an app on Marketplace [[TV][2.5] Preview an app on Marketplace](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1211400), as measured by implementation (completeness and stability of the feature)
2. To lift the restrictions for gaia developers to use third-party NPM packages, we'll continue and deliver detailed plan for [refactoring build system run-time to node.js](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia/Build/RefactoringToNodejs), as measured by implementation progress. (This is a long term plan so this goal does not aim for shipping on this quarter.)
3. CI machines are able to run / switch multi-version node.js in order to support new gaia build (node.js v4.x) and testing framework (node.js v0.10.x), as measured by implementation progress. (This is a long term plan so this goal does not aim for shipping on this quarter.)
4. Investigate new Gaia build 2.0 - confidant with Gareth, as measured by planning progress.
5. Fix bugs of build system, as measured by blocker burn down and days of blocker turnarounds.
